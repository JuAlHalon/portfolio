                <p>Welcome to my portfolio. On this site I have collected various school projects and assignments that I think are noteworthy. 
                    You can find the projects under their respective categories and there is a description of each work. Each work's header is a 
                    link to that work's Github -repository.
                My Github profile can be visited by using the Github link in the navigation bar.</p>
                <p>I have graduated from JAMK University for Applied Sciences with a bachelor's degree of business information technology in 2023.
                    Nearing the end of my studies I worked at Solteq Plc Utilities Unit as a full-stack developer for 1.5 years, working on web apps
                    for Finnish energy sector companies. Alongside professional work experience with web app development, I also have some experience
                    in game development from my time at JAMK.
                </p>               
                <p>The programming languages I have most experience in are C#, javascript, typescript and C++.
                    During my work I have also got experience from SQL and Entity Framework.
                    I also have some experience using frameworks/libraries including Angular, Node.js and Express from during my studies and ASP.NET and jQuery from work.
                    On game development side of things I have experience developing games with Unity.</p>
